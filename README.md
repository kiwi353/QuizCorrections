### Question 7

I don't know what I did wrong on this question and I believe that I am correct in my answer. I would like to see you during co to clarify what I did wrong (or right). To clarify there should be no difference (at least for the purpose of answering the question) that let x; x=27; should be any different from let x = 27;

### Question 9

I answered that characters and floating-points are both valid data types in JS. This is not true they are valid data types in many other languages but not javascript. However, symbols and objects are both valid data types in JS.

### Question 5

While the question mark is a symbol that appears in ternary operators it is not considered a logical operator. However, the ! used to negate values is a valid logical operator.

### Question 15

I assumed that a do while loop will run like a traditional while loop if formatted with the while statement in the normal position. This is not true. In addition there was a mother do while statement that fit the required parameters to run for a finite amount of time that I did not select.

### Question 10

I believe I got this question correct too. The answers says that math.Random does not return a value but from my own practice and research I believe it does. I would like to meet during co to discuss.

### Question 13

For this question I did not account for that fact that specifically var values are pushed up in scope when declared in block scope. Based on this the correct answer would be that 1 and 2 are printed to the console because the y variable's scope will be pushed up to function scope.

### Question 3 

I did not remember that .includes() is a valid function in JS. The function returns true if an array contains at least 1 instance of the given parameter and false otherwise.

### Question 6

I missed that .push() can take in a variable amount of parameters. Doing this will give the same result as multiple .push() functions pushing each different value.
